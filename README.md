# Project-Heartbeat-VFX-Mod
A mod for Project Heartbeat that enables the VFX Shader Pack.

If you want to try to install it the fancy way, here is how to do it:

It's a lot easier to just install this instead:

Instructions:
Find the file called "Project Heartbeat.pck" in your Steam folder and replace it with the one in the google link.
Don't discard your old one, you'll want to keep it around.
You *will* want the VFXScripts, because the actual shader code itself is stored in your editor_scripts folder and the in-game mod depends on the shaders being in your scripts folder.
All of the dependencies for the mod are included with the VFX Scripts, so if you aren't getting any VFX, it's probably because you're missing something there.

WARNING: This mod contains amateur, untested, AI-generated code. It was made purely in the spirit of tinkering with the game, and my 'careful' code review doesn't indicate anything that would harm your computer, but I am still using this software at my own risk,
which means you are as well, if you choose to. This is *not* the official game in any capacity - it is a mod that requires a legal copy of the official game to work.
