# Project-Heartbeat-VFX-Mod
A mod for Project Heartbeat that enables the VFX Shader Pack.

It's a lot easier to just install this instead:

Instructions:
Find the file called "Project Heartbeat.pck" in your Steam folder and replace it with the one in the google link.
Don't discard your old one, you'll want to keep it around.
You *will* want the VFXScripts, because the actual shader code itself is stored in your editor_scripts folder and the in-game mod depends on the shaders being in your scripts folder.
Also the anim_bank needs to be in the Utilities folder.
